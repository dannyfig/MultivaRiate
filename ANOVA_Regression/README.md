## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Regression

#### Instructions
Gather data having at least 20 observations where there is a numerical target variable
of interest, and there are two predicting variables that are used to model the target. One
of the predictors should be a categorical variable with at least three levels. The other
predictor can have any form you want â€” numerical or categorical (if categorical, with
any number of levels you want). The groups defined by the categorical variable should
come naturally from the context of the question of interest.

#### Summary
I gathered my data using [Enigma's public data platform](https://app.enigma.io/table/edu.umd.start.gtd). The dataset is originally sourced from the University of Maryland's *Global Terrorism Database*, which has been recording instances of terrorism since 1970. 
Each observation is an individual instace of terrorism, and I was most curious about the naturally devastating numbers: numbers of deaths/wounded.

I wanted to discover if there were a collection of features that would allow me to build a relatively accurate multivariate model of the predicted number of deaths in a given terrorist attack. I had to enforce a few restrictions on which subset of data I looked at, and in the end I believe those restrictions made the model less applicable. That said, building the model was a useful exercise in modeling and analysis.
