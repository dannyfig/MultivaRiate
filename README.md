# MultivaRiate
This repository is a short-term work-in-progress where I'll be contributing any data analysis reports and scripts I write for a course I'm taking this semester, *Regression and Multivariate Data Analysis* at the Stern School for Business.
 
The scripts will be written in **R** so that I can build up my experience with data analysis and scripting.
 
The data analysis will be a general word document covering my findings. The course is centered around using linear regressions in order to extract insights from data and answer questions pertaining to the data.
 
As usual, all work is my own and is open to criticism.
 
### File structure
Every sub-directory in this repo *should* (ideally) be one data analysis and hold the relevant scripts it utilizes.
 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me here on Github or through email at <danny.vilela@nyu.edu>.
 
Thanks!
