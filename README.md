# MultivaRiate
This repository is a short collection of reports I wrote for a course I took during the Spring 2016 semester, *Regression and Multivariate Data Analysis* (STAT-UB 0017) at the Stern School for Business.
 
The scripts were written in **R** with the hopes of learning more about statistical programming. Unfortunately, my code is unpleasant. Read at your own risk.
 
The data analyses are an in-depth document covering my findings. The course is centered around using linear regressions in order to extract insights from data and answer questions pertaining to the data.
 
As usual, all work is my own and is open to criticism.
 
### File structure
Every sub-directory in this repo is one assignment for the course, which is a particular approach to regression (Simple, Multiple, Time Series, ANOVA, etc.). Each sub-directory is also self-contained and the code, data, and report in each can be generated with only the contents in that sub-directory.
 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me here on Github or through email at <danny.vilela@nyu.edu>.
 
Thanks!
